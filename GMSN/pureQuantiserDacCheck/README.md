This is a simple firmware for GMSN's Pure Quantiser that is meant to help check whether your DAC works or not.

What it does is play eight notes (seven notes of a major scale + octave up of the root). The values for those notes are sent to the DAC, allowing you to check if it produces CV output.
If that works, you can flash Rob's original firmware and enter VU Meter mode to see if your ADC is working too.

Also, since each note of this firmware plays for 4 seconds, you can use it to tune the quantizer.

Happy debugging!
